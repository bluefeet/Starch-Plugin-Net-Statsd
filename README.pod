=head1 NAME

Starch::Plugin::Net::Statsd - Record store timing information to statsd.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $starch = Starch->new(
        plugins => ['::Net::Statsd'],
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will record get, set, and remove store timings to statsd
using L<Net::Statsd>.

By default, for example, if you are using L<Starch::Store::Memory>, stats
like this will be recorded:

    starch.memory.set
    starch.memory.get-hit
    starch.memory.get-miss
    starch.memory.remove
    starch.memory.set-error
    starch.memory.get-error
    starch.memory.remove-error

Note that stats will not be collected for L<Starch::Store::Layered>, as
data about it isn't really useful as its just a proxy store.

=head1 MANAGER OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=head2 statsd_host

Setting this will cause the C<$Net::Statsd::HOST> variable to be
localized to it before the timing information is recorded.

=head2 statsd_port

Setting this will cause the C<$Net::Statsd::PORT> variable to be
localized to it before the timing information is recorded.

=head2 statsd_root_path

The path to store all of the Starch timing stats in, defaults to
C<starch>.

=head2 statsd_sample_rate

The sample rate to use, defaults to C<1>.  See L<Net::Statsd/ABOUT SAMPLING>.

=head1 STORE OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=head2 statsd_path

The path prefix which will be appended to the L</statsd_root_path>.
Defaults to L<Starch::Store/short_store_class_name>, but normalized to
be a valid graphite path.

=head2 statsd_full_path

This is the full path, C<statsd_root_path.statsd_path>.  This can be
set to override L</statsd_root_path> and L</statsd_path>.
